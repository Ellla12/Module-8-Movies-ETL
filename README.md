# Module 8: Movies ETL

## Overview
Amazing Prime Video team is hosting a Hackathon to predict the most popular movies from a clean movie dataset. To do that, Britta from Amazing Prime is tasked with creating the dataset for the Hackathon. She will need to extract the data from a wikipedia source and rating data from the movielens website. We are tasked with helping her throughout the ETL process: extract the Wikipedia and Kaggle data from their respective files, transform the datasets by cleaning them up and joining them together, and load the cleaned dataset into a SQL database. 

The purpose of the from this module is to:
- Refactor the code from this module to create one function from the following files: Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data.
- Perform the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database
